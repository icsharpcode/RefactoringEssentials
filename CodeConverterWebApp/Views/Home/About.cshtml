        <p>
            A service provided by <a href="http://vsrefactoringessentials.com/">Refactoring Essentials for Visual Studio</a>.
            It is included in the Visual Studio extension (v4.0+), where it runs locally without calling out to this REST API.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code you submit is not stored in any form. Therefore, if an error occurs in conversion, we would like to ask
            you to <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/RefactoringEssentials/issues">report it</a> using the label "code converter".
            Please do include the code snippet (if possible) so we can find (and thus fix) the problem as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            This service is brought to you by the same people that created <a href="http://codeconverter.sharpdevelop.net/">http://codeconverter.sharpdevelop.net/</a>.
            In comparison, this service today supports only C# to VB.NET, however in their respective latest versions - whereas the <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory/">NRefactory</a>-based
            older service is C# 5.0 only (and won't be updated any more).
        </p>
        <p>
            Current <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/RefactoringEssentials/blob/master/converter.txt">limitations</a> are documented, the most important being comments and preprocessor directives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code for this Web site can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/RefactoringEssentials">Refactoring Essentials</a>
            repository. The client library for the REST API plus some smaller clients are accessible via the <a href="https://github.com/christophwille/roslyncodeconverterclients">clients repository</a>,
            which has a downloadable release of the <a href="https://github.com/christophwille/roslyncodeconverterclients/releases">Windows desktop client</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, help is appreciated - eg converters for other language combinations. Please open an issue when intending to do so.
        </p>
