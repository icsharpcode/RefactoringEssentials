Converter:

Known limitations and bugs:
- Web UI does not report syntax errors
- Comments are not converted
- Preprocessor directives are not converted

We probably cannot convert all preprocessor directives exactly without changing the semantics.

Missing features and bugs:
C# to VB:
- unsafe code cannot be converted

VB to C#:
- not implemented
